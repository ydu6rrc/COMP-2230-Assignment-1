# My Reflection

**Can I explain what my code does?**

For the first part, I followed a very simple way. I have a head, and inside the head I put the standard UTF-8 encoding and also the screen fit for every device. I also add a title, so it can be seen in the tab bar. Then I have a body, and in the body I put footer and header. I also used alt to explain my image, so it can describe for people who need it. After that is my main resume parts. I separated each section, and I also used lists and level-3 headings. At the end, I also have one SVG picture which represent Red River College.

**What was my coding process?**

My coding process is mainly I first create the framework. I looked at the note and also follow the example to make my own resume. Later I divided it into different sections, and I try to give each section some different way to show it.

**What challenges did I have?**

Mainly it is about accessibility. I checked many reference materials, and I also used axe tools but cannot see problem. But the requirement ask me to use aria to add content, so I spend some extra time on it.

**What would I do differently now?**

I think if I start from beginning again, I will make all the sections ready first, not add later. This way will be much more convenient.
